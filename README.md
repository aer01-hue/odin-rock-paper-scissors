            The Odin Project Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This project is played entirely in the browser. Building the game focused on problem solving by planning the solution, writing the code and testing to make sure that it worked.

I added a UI to the game. The user can now play the game where they no longer have to input their selection, and can use buttons instead.

To make the game more user-friendly, I made a few changes:

    * Centered the game to the middle of the screen.
    * Changed the buttons font sizes and color to the buttons.
    * Added a clear button to reset the game.
